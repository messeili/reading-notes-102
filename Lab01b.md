## The difference between Fixed and Growth Mindset
I summarized the difference between them in the below table:  


Criteria | Growth Mindset | Fixed Mindset
---------|----------------|--------------
Challenges | Embraces | Avoids
Obstacles | Persists | Loses focus
Effort | Handles the Pain | Views as fruitless
Success of others | is inspired by | view as a threat  

### How to keep myself in a growth mindset
* try to focus on effort not talent
* try to speak to positive and open-minded people
* try to remember my past accomplishments to keep in my mind that I'm capable of succeed
* keep trying new tactics
* Get inspired from successful people
